Project Overview: 
This project is a Python based web application and dynamic data scraper. As of right now, it visits DoorDash, UberEats, and Grubhub
and scrapes the price of a breakfast meal from them. Using this data, it creates a simple website that neatly compares side by side prices. If the prices change,
the code will show the updated price.

THIS CODE WILL ONLY WORK IF EXECUTED BETWEEN 12:00 AM to 5:00 AM (BECAUSE IT SCRAPES THE BREAKFAST MENU)
THIS CODE WILL ONLY WORK IF VSCODE MEETS ALL OF THE STEPS AND REQUIREMENTS BELOW
THIS CODE WILL ONLY WORK IF THE INTEGRATED TERMINAL HAS NO BUGS WHILE RUNNING
